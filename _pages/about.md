<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Research Scientist in the Alibaba-NTU Global e-Sustainability CorpLab (ANGEL) at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), 
working with Prof. <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/wslin/Home.html">Weisi Lin</a>. 
Before that, I was a postdoctoral fellow at McMaster University (Mac), Canada from July 2022 to August 2024, 
supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZuQnEIgAAAAJ">Xiaolin Wu</a>.
I was also an assistant researcher at Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), 
supervised by Prof. <a href="https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=14">Hongkai Xiong</a>.
I earned my PhD from SJTU in June 2022 and my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Mathematics and Physics Basic Science from UESTC in 2015.

My current research interests focus on green and energy-efficient AI technologies that prioritize sustainable ecosystems and lifestyles. 
Previously, I concentrated on learning-based data compression techniques, particularly for visual data such as images, videos, point clouds, and light fields. 
Additionally, I am interested in core deep learning challenges, including domain generalization and visual reasoning.
<!-- I have published more than 10 papers at the top AI Journals and conferences such as T-PAMI, T-IP, NeurIPS, CVPR, ECCV, AAAI, etc. -->
