I am currently an assistant researcher and a postdoctoral fellow at Department of Electronic Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), supervised by Prof. <a href="https://min.sjtu.edu.cn/En/FacultyShow/4?Vid=14">Hongkai Xiong</a>.
I am also a visiting researcher at McMaster University (Mac), Canada since June 2023. Previously, I was a visiting researcher at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), Denmark from June 2022 to May 2023.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree from SJTU in 2022, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZuQnEIgAAAAJ">Xiaolin Wu</a>. I was a visiting Ph.D. student (2019 - 2020) with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at McMaster University, Canada.  Before that, I received my bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics Basic Science from UESTC in 2015.

My research interests include learning-based signal processing, particularly in data compression, including image, video, point cloud, and light field compression.
I am also interested in other deep learning tasks such as domain generalization and visual reasoning. I have published more than 10 papers
with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=78WvEjMAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>600+</span></strong></a>
